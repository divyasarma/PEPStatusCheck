# Stacc code challenge 2021

This is a solution designed to help decide if a customer is politically exposed(PEP -Politically Exposed Person).
The application uses React as front-end and Node as backend.


## Task description

The app serves a front end web page where we can enter the details(eg: Full Name) of the customer whose status needs to be checked.
This returns the details including date of birth, PEP status and a PEP score of the customer. The PEP score is determined according to the level of political exposure of a person.

If there are multiple people with the same name, details of all of them are displayed in a tabular format.

If the details of the person are not available, a Person Not Found! message is displayed.
